README for ffmpeg-java

NOTE: ffmpeg-java is not the same thing as FMJ, which stands for "Freedom for Media in Java".  ffmpeg-java is a subproject of FMJ.

ffmpeg-java is a Java wrapper around ffmpeg, using JNA.

It assumes that dynamic libraries for ffmpeg have been compiled, and are in your library path.

Note: mmx is disabled in this example, as it has caused problems in the past.


Step 1: Get ffmpeg sources from http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/


Step 2: build/install ffmpeg

./configure --disable-mmx --enable-shared
make
sudo make install


Step 3. run one of the sample programs with a media file as the first parameter.

You may need to set your library path in order to find the installed ffmpeg dynamic libraries, for example:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

PlayerExample: plays a movie in a window
java -cp ./ffmpeg-java.jar:./lib/jna.jar net.sf.ffmpeg_java.example.PlayerExample http://www.javasaver.com/testjs/jmf/anim/2005-11-26.mov

AVCodecSample: creates 5 ppm files in the current directory with the first 5 frames of the movie:
java -cp ./ffmpeg-java.jar:./lib/jna.jar net.sf.ffmpeg_java.example.AVCodecSample http://www.javasaver.com/testjs/jmf/anim/2005-11-26.mov


Notes from Stephan Goetter:


Very good documentation how to setup build environment (msys and mingw) and how to build ffmpeg on windows can be found here:

http://arrozcru.no-ip.org/ffmpeg_wiki/tiki-index.php

The ffmpeg builts provided at http://arrozcru.no-ip.org/ffmpeg_builds/ have worked too,  but some image codec/format were missing.
