 ===SVN===
 * Changed default for quality.2channel to zero, effectively disabling it.  Newer ffmpeg doesn't like to do this for 5.1 aac -> 2 channel ac3
 * Added support for new ffmpeg, AVStream->sample_aspect_ratio 
 
 ===V0.20===
 * Added initial support for .tivo files
  * Thanks to work by davidblackledge & wmcbrine
  * Due to streaming bandwidth issues, tivo may have a hard time keeping up.
  * No support for random positioning within a .tivo file--  Must always start from the beginning.
  * Because of the above, there is no support for rebuffering at 1.1G point (and .tivo files are usually large)
  * Due to all of the above, streaming .tivo files is not really that useful ;-)
 * Fixed audio channels parsing support for ffmpegexe
 * Modified MP4 streaming code to not interleave if initial audio/video chunks are with 4 megabytes of each other.
 * If MP4 pseudo-streaming can't perform the correct positioning, try again at beginning
  * This usually happens at the beginning of a file anyway
 * Drop -ac parameter from default for ffmpegexe transcode
 * Moved all assets (icons/images) into asset directory
 * Changed icon theme.  Icons are searched in assets directory
 * Added icon/bkg config options icon.icon=, icon.folder=, icon.movie=  
  * Files are relative to the assets directory
 * Added new config option ignore.dotfiles.  Set to false if you want files/folders with a dot included
 * Added new config option remember.password.  Set to false to not remember password from session to session
 * Added support for testing-- ".raw" files
  * Will stream to tivo without any processing
  * Assumes video/mpeg for mimeType and Content-Type by default
  * if file videofile.raw.fmt exists, the first line is taken as the mime type to use, and the second as the Content-Type
 * Support for EDL file cutlists.  Looks for movie.ext.edl (so movie.mpg.edl for example)
  * TiVo doesn't seem to really like jumping around in MP4's too much.  Not sure how good this will work for MP4
  * MPG seems better, but I still am not sure how accurate the timings are.
  * cut.startoffset, cut.endoffset can be used to adjust the timings in milliseconds.  Defaults are 0
   * startoffset will wait this long after seeing a cut point to jump
   * endoffset will jump this many milliseconds before the cut point says the end should be
 * Changed default port to 7290
 * Changed IDLE/timeout code, thanks to wmcbrine
 * Added support for different transcoding qualities.  If a quality other than SAME is chosen, it may force transcoding.
 * Added FLV container support, and changed defaults for ffmpeg preview/transcode to try and work with all containers "*"
 * Added config option to skip top-level folders screen if there is only one accessible directory (toplevel.skip=true)
 * Streambaby looks for property streambaby.dir and uses that as the rootdir for streambaby if set
  * Can be used (for instance) in galleon wrapper.conf file to set where streambabby looks for files
 * Also Added config option streambaby.dir to set up where the streambaby directory is.  Also changed the way native path is initialized.
 * When transcoding, find the closest allowable mpeg frame rate.
  
 ===V0.19===
 * Added MKV to default list of extensions to scan
 * Catch NumberFormatExceptions and return default values while trying to parse ffmpeg output
 * cahoon/KG:  Fix off-by-one issue (causing ArrayIndexOutOfbounds) in MP4 psuedo-streaming 
 * Changed preview cache cleanup code to work faster/use less memory & deal with recursive symlinks
 * Added additional debugging for loading of native ffmpeg libraries  
 * Fixed bug where saved bookmark position ended up negative (caused Play/Replay screen to not have correct text positioning)
 * TiVo doesn't seem to report correct duration for MP4's (always seems to report ~8secs less).
   * Added code to work-around by using my own calculated duration if I receive RSRC_EVENT_COMPLETE from tivo and its duration is shorter than expected
   * Still some weirdness around end of MP4s--  Shuttle bar will stop moving around 8 seconds before end...
 * Fixed centering of shuttlebar -- Also made it wider while I was at it.
  
===V0.18===
 * Made changes to compile under JDK1.5, and marked as JDK1.5 compatible
 * Added ability to gather video information (length/type/etc) without ffmpeg, enabling running without ffmpeg installed (but minus some features)
 * Ignore files/directories that begin with a dot (.)
 * Added liba52 as synonym for AC3, mp4aac as synonym for AAC in ffmpegexe module
 * Added hints for the list, so you can visually see if there are more entries than fit on the screen
 * Advance key moves back and from bottom to top of list in selection view
 * Fixed issue with ffmpeg native integration where libavcodec was V51, and libavformat was V52 (used to assume major versions would be equal)
  * NOTE:  FFmpeg revisions `r10939-r11109` (Nov 7 2007 - Nov 28 2007) will not work, and will also not report any errors. 
 * Implement new codec detection code for ffmpegjava video module, should have less problems detecting which codecs are in use.
